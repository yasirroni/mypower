# myPower

Supplementary function and port of [MATPOWER](https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower) in Python. myPower stands for Matlab Python Ported MATPOWER.

## mypower/

Containing original myPower function.

## mypower/matpower_ported

Containing callable ported MATPOWER function with Oct2Py nout = max_nout.

Due MATPOWER folder naming, there is some changes in folder naming:

Path name is replaced for:

    @   : at_

    -   : _

If dir name already exist in python module, the dir name is revised:

    dirname     : _dirname

# Requirements

## Octave (Tutorial for Windows 10)

1. Download [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html) zip.
2. Add new Environment Variable to execute `octave-cli`.

    ```
    Variable name: OCTAVE_EXECUTABLE
    Variable value: location:\\of\\octave\\bin\\octave-cli.exe
    ```

3. Restart computer to make 'os.environ' recognize the new path.
4. To test, open Command Prompt, run python, import oct2py.

    ```python
    import oct2py
    ```

## Library

myPower needs [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [oct2py](https://github.com/blink1073/oct2py) to be used.

```bash
pip install numpy oct2py
```

## Matpower

### Windows (command prompt)

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower/archive/refs/tags/7.1.zip > matpower.zip
tar -xf matpower.zip
del matpower7.1.zip
```

# Notable of functions

1. losses_kron: Compute losses based on Kron's coefficient
2. losses_kron_slope: Compute losses based on Taylor series of Kron's coefficient
3. makeB_kron: Make B based on Kron's method
4. makeB_kron_slope: Make first derivative of B Matrices of Kron method
5. to_mypc: Revert mypc indexing to start from 1 for octave compatibility
6. to_mypc0: Fix mypc bus indexing to start from 0 for Pyhton compatibility

# Usage

To use oct2py based MATPOWER, use:

```python
from mypower.oc_api import oc_matpower

oc = oc_matpower()
mypc = oc.runpf()
```

To use myPower original function, use:

```python
import mypower as myp

B_kron,mypc_kr = myp.makeB_kron(case_name,oc=oc)
```

To use MATPOWER ported (bridge) using oct2py with max nout, use:

```python
from mypower.matpower_api import runpf

result = runpf()
[MVAbase, bus, gen, branch, success, et] = result
```

See tutorial for detailed example.
